# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game built with Python. The program selects a random number within a user-defined range, and the player has **7 attempts** to guess the correct number.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter the start and end of the range.
2. The computer randomly picks a number within that range.
3. The user has 7 chances to guess the correct number.
4. After each guess, the program provides feedback:
   - If the guess is **too high**, it advises to try a lower number.
   - If the guess is **too low**, it advises to try a higher number.
   - If the guess is **correct**, it congratulates the user and ends the game.

If the user fails to guess the number within 7 tries, the correct number is revealed.
